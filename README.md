# ATM Simulation System (C++)

## Project Overview
This is a console-based **ATM Simulation System** developed in C++ using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **file handling**.  
The system allows users to register, log in securely using a PIN, and perform basic ATM operations in a simple and interactive way.

## Core Features
- User registration (Name, PIN, Initial Deposit)
- Secure login system
- Balance inquiry
- Cash deposit
- Cash withdrawal
- Transaction history
- Persistent data storage using files

## Technical Concepts Used
- C++ Classes & Objects  
- File Handling (`fstream`)  
- Structures (`struct`)  
- Encapsulation  
- Menu-driven programming  
- Data persistence  
- Input validation  

## Data Storage
- `users.txt` → Stores registered user accounts  
- `transactions.txt` → Stores transaction records  

## Purpose of Project
This project is designed to demonstrate:
- Practical implementation of OOP in C++
- Real-world simulation of banking/ATM systems
- File-based data management
- Logical structuring of a complete software system

## Use Case
Suitable for:
- Academic projects  
- Programming portfolios  
- GitHub repositories  
- OOP practice  
- Interview demonstrations  
- Learning file handling in C++
